# Weblists is like a Craiglist website based on philippines only. Please note that this is a personal project

on this project, I use:
1. HTML
2. Javascript
3. node js with express
5. ejs template
6. postgres SQL

to check how it works
1. after cloning, make sure to run "npm i" to install necessary packages
2. then run "npm start" to check it on the browser.
3. you can use Github Codespace or in your local machine.
